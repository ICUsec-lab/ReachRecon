> **ReachRecon** is a blazing-fast Python tool to organize your pentest by checking which targets are live.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Live Subdomain Checker:** Quickly find which subdomains are up (e.g., `admin.example.com`).
- **Live URL Checker:** Validate which web URLs are reachable (e.g., `http://admin.example.com`).
- **Smart Conversion:** Convert subdomain lists to full web URLs and back.
- **Multithreaded:** Super-fast results thanks to multithreading.
- **Clean Output:** Skips dead targets to keep your results clean and actionable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use ReachRecon?

During recon, you may collect hundreds of subdomains or URLsâ€”but not all are alive.
Scanning dead ones wastes time and resources.

**ReachRecon helps you:**
- âœ… Focus only on valid attack surfaces.
- âœ… Organize recon data for better exploitation.
- âœ… Easily chain results with tools like `ffuf`, `nuclei`, `httpx`, etc.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

### âœ… Check live subdomains
```bash
python3 ReachRecon.py -s -f subs.txt
